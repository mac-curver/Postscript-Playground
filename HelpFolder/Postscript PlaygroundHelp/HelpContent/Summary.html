		<h3><a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h3>
		<p>Version 1.6.1 co 2023-06 LegoEsprit. </p>
		<p>Due to usage of an external tool, the application can't run in Sandboxed environment (In fact on the development Mac sandboxing works, but not on other Macs). Nevertheless Ventura limits some accesses make using the application a bit more cumbersome than intended.
        </p>
		<p>Additionally are some limits.
			<ul>
			<li>
				For example the syntax high lighting is not implemented efficiently. Therefore the systax high-lighting is automatically disabled when the Postscript file consists of more than 10000 characters. This are typically less than 500 lines. Nevertheless the used converting tool is quite fast and will transfer even large multipage Postscript files into PDF. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Only a small part of the large Postscript vocabulary is supported for the Syntax highlighting. This consists only of Postscript level 1 commands that are used quite frequently. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The editor supports only limitted capabilities. The total size is limitted to about 300000 characters.
			</li>
			</ul>

		<p>The help is displayed as pure html and is not integrated into the Apple help system. While former times this was relatively easy to do, no documentation except outdated and non working files from 2010 could be found to solve this issue.</p>
